store.
Create Store Segments &amp; detailed segment profiles using the provided Store Demographic &amp; Store Sales
Data. Below are guidelines to be followed while building the store segments
1. Each segment should be greater than 5% of total # stores
2. We should restrict total # segments to not more than 7

## Store Demand Forecasting:
Forecast weekly Store &amp; ECOM Sales (Store number 57) to help better plan inventory for the upcoming
fiscal year. Leverage the attached Store Sales Data for the same.
Please state forecast accuracy metrics on your presentation as well. Ideal would be to compare multiple
